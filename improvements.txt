improvements

-> Changes apply in search box. rather than user type full city name now using autosuggest its popup the city name automatially and
reflect in map with selected area

-> update to the navigation panel 
passing textbox value to another page for navigation purpose does not implement thats why 
there is copy text button for user so when user select pushpin it will copy the waterfall name 
and than redirect to naigation panel on other page


-> showin use the current cordinate rather than you are here (ex.hamilton,ontario)
this thing fulfill under search bar

-> changes in user interface design as pe few people feedback after usablitiy testing
